## Summary

Building on the NFL Big Data Bowl tracking and play data, we can design novel position‐specific metrics that leverage spatio‐temporal information to uncover insights not yet explored in football analytics. Below are ten proposed research topics—ranging from “Expected Catch Probability” to “Player Influence Centrality”—each tied to real NFL data sources and methodologies. We then highlight which of these are most feasible to prototype in a single day, ensuring you can deliver compelling results for your one-page executive summary and any supporting technical documentation.

## Ten Novel Research Topics

1. **Expected Catch Probability (ECP)**
   Estimate the likelihood that a thrown ball is successfully caught by modeling factors such as target distance, defender proximity, and receiver speed—analogous to soccer’s expected goals (xG) metric ([Comparisonator AI Football Scouting][1]). Utilize Next Gen Stats tracking to assign each catch opportunity a value between 0 and 1, reflecting catch probability.

2. **Vertical Success Rate Grade (VSRG)**
   Grade each receiver on their success winning contested catches at different vertical zones (e.g., high‐point throws versus low passes). ESPN’s Receiver Tracking Metrics already segment “contesting and making the catch” phases; VSRG would formalize this into a continuous grade per play ([ESPN.com][2]).

3. **Separation Consistency Index (SCI)**
   Quantify a receiver’s ability to maintain separation from defenders throughout a route by measuring the average and variance of distance between receiver and nearest defender during a target window ([SumerSports][3]).

4. **Pre-Snap Route Predictability Entropy (PRE)**
   Compute the entropy of actual routes run by receivers aligned in a given formation. Low entropy indicates highly predictable play designs, while high entropy suggests creative route concepts. Use the Big Data Bowl’s play-type labels to map route classes and calculate entropy per formation ([Kaggle][4], [NFL Football Operations][5]).

5. **Offensive Line Pressure Prevention Index (OLPPI)**
   For each offensive lineman, measure the reduction in quarterback pressure events attributable to their blocking assignments. Leverage tracking data to detect pass-rush proximity and collisions, then allocate pressure “saves” back to individual linemen ([NFL Football Operations][6]).

6. **Defender Anticipation Metric (DAM)**
   Assess how early a defender breaks toward the ball after snap. Using tracking, record the time delta between snap and first movement toward the catch or ball carrier. Compare across defenders to identify elite pre-reaction skills ([Kaggle][7]).

7. **Running Back Vision Score (RBVS)**
   Model a running back’s path efficiency through line/arbitrary gaps by comparing their actual movement trajectory to an “ideal” path that maximizes yardage. Curve‐fitting algorithms on tracking points reveal RB vision and agility ([NFL Football Operations][6]).

8. **Quarterback Decision Speed Metric (QDSM)**
   Measure the time between snap and throw/disposal, adjusted for pass rush pressure. Faster, accurate decisions under duress correlate with QB effectiveness. Use playClock and velocity data from tracking to calculate QDSM per dropback ([NFL Football Operations][6]).

9. **Tackle Success Probability (TSP)**
   Estimate the probability a defender will successfully tackle a ball carrier based on closing speed, angle, and evasion moves. Assign each missed or successful tackle a probability score, then aggregate to rate defenders ([Kaggle][7]).

10. **Player Influence Centrality (PIC)**
    Construct a player-interaction graph per play (nodes = players, edges = proximity or handoff events) and compute network centrality measures (e.g., PageRank) to identify which players most influence play outcomes. This GNN-inspired approach captures emergent coordination ([The Washington Post][8]).

| PIC                                | Full player graph per play     | Graph centrality algorithms   | ❌                  |

* **Top Three Prototypes (✅):**

  1. **ECP:** Requires only play-level event labels and position deltas; a logistic regression or simple tree model can be built in a few hours.
  2. **VSRG:** Uses existing contest flags and z-axis data; scoring formula can be implemented with pandas/Spark aggregations.
  3. **SCI:** Computes receiver-defender distance over time; only needs distance and timestamp columns to derive mean and variance metrics.

These three combine low ETL overhead with high interpretability and novelty, making them ideal for a one-day deep dive. You can use Kaggle’s preloaded CSVs for quick ingestion ([Kaggle][7]), focus on extracted subsets (e.g., one week of plays ([NFL Football Operations][6])), and deliver clear visualizations and actionable insights for your one-page executive summary.
